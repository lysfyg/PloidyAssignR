Description: A computational framework, which utilizes single-cell template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) data to systematically assign somatic single cell ploidy and SCNA events independent of an extrinsic ploidy assumption.
 Ploidy detection from strand-specific reads relies on the fact that different ploidy states (such as 2n, 4n or 6n) result in distinct, but predictable, homolog segregation patterns within a cell population.
 These are reflected by read orientation patterns, which can be exploited to assign the copy number for every chromosome independently.
 The ploidy detected is essentially the consensus ploidy across the entire cell population and represents the predominant or clonal copy number within the sample set.
 From this, PloidyAssignR can also infer single cell copy number, without relying on a reference sample, haplotype phasing, or copy status of other chromosomes and/or genomic loci.
 We additionally developed an R Shiny app, allowing interactive visualization of ploidy changes and somatic structural variations in single cells.
